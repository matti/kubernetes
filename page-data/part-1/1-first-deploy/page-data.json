Before we get started with anything else we'll need to define what a microservice is. Currently there are a many different definitions for microservices.</p><p>For this course we'll choose the definition set by Sam Newman in <a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/building-microservices/9781491950340/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Building Microservices</a>: \"<strong>Microservices are small, autonomous services that work together</strong>\". The opposite of a microservice is a service that is self-contained and independent called a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monolithic_application\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Monolith</a>.</p><p>The misconception of microservices being a large number of extremely small services is proliferated by large enterprises. If you have an extremely large enterprise where teams don't even know the existence of other teams you may have an unconventionally large number of microservices. Due to the insanity of a large number of small services without any good reasoning we're witnessing the term monolith trending in 2020.</p><ul>\n<li>\"Monoliths are the future\" - Kelsey Hightower, Staff Developer Advocate at Google, <a href=\"https://changelog.com/posts/monoliths-are-the-future\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">\"Monoliths are the Future\"</a></li>\n</ul><p>For the context of this unpopular opinion, Kelsey Hightower points out at \"The problem people try to solve with microservices doesn't really line up with reality\", leading to <em>Distributed Monoliths</em> where you have a large number of microservices without a good reason.</p><ul>\n<li>\"Run a small team, not a tech behemoth? Embrace the monolith and make it majestic. You Deserve It!\" - David Heinemeier Hansson, cofounder &#x26; CTO at Basecamp, <a href=\"https://m.signalvnoise.com/the-majestic-monolith/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">\"The Majestic Monolith\"</a></li>\n</ul><p>And this evolves into <a href=\"https://m.signalvnoise.com/the-majestic-monolith-can-become-the-citadel/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">\"The Majestic Monolith can become The Citadel\"</a> with the following: \"next step is The Citadel, which keeps the Majestic Monolith at the center, but supports it with a set of Outposts, each extracting a small subset of application responsibilities.\"</p><p>When to use microservices? In the following video where Sam Newman and Martin Fowler discuss microservices, the answer is: \"When you've got a really good reason\".</p><p>It also includes the top 3 reasons for using microservices:</p><ul>\n<li>Zero-downtime independent deployability</li>\n<li>Isolation of data and of processing around that data</li>\n<li>Use microservices to reflect the organizational structure</li>\n</ul><p><strong>When To Use Microservices (And When Not To!)</strong></p><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/GBTdnfD6s5Q\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe><p>A big topic in the video was also the <em>Distributed Monolith</em>, where the services are not independently deployable. This is possibly part of the reason why microservices are so hard to define. A simple definition such as \"A microservice is any service that is smaller than a monolith\", can be used to claim that a Distributed Monolith is a microservice. So a seemingly microservice architecture that does not have the benefits of a microservice architecture may actually be a disguised monolith.</p><p>Since it is so hard to define rather than going first into microservices we should listen to the first two takeaways from the video that are \"One should use microservices as a means to obtain a desired outcome rather than for the sake of using a new technology\" and \"Microservices shouldn't be the default option. If you think a service architecture could help, try it with one of the modules from a very simple monolith typology and let it evolve from there\".</p><p>However, sometimes during this course we'll do <strong>arbitrary</strong> splits to our services just to show the features of Kubernetes. So even though we are doing \"<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y8OnoxKotPQ\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">microservices</a>\" in this course, a healthy amount of scepticism is required around microservices in the real world. We will see at least one actual and well-justified use case for microservices with service scaling during the course.</p><h2 id=\"what-is-kubernetes\" style=\"position:relative;\">What is Kubernetes?<a href=\"#what-is-kubernetes\" aria-label=\"what is kubernetes permalink\" class=\"anchor after\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a></h2><p>Let's say you have 3 processes and 2 computers incapable of running all 3 processes. How would you approach this problem?</p><p>You'll have to start by deciding which 2 processes go on the same computer and which 1 will be on the different one. How would you fit them? By having the ones demanding most resources and the least resources on the same machine or having the most demanding be on its own? Maybe you want to add one process and now you have to reorganize all of them. What happens when you have more than 2 computers and more than 3 processes? One of the processes is eating all of the memory and you need to get that away from the \"critical-bank-application\". Should we virtualize everything? Containers would solve that problem, right? Would you move the most important process to a new computer? Maybe some of the processes need to communicate with each other and now you have to deal with networking. What if one of the computers break? What about your Friday plans to visit the local Craft brewery?</p><p>What if you could just define \"This process should have 6 copies using X amount of resources.\" and have the 2..N computers working as a single entity to fulfill your request?

With k3d our basic cluster will look like this:</p><span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 501px; margin-bottom: 1rem;\">\n      <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\" style=\"padding-bottom: 45.21739130434783%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url(&apos;data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAABQAAAAJCAYAAAAywQxIAAAACXBIWXMAAAsTAAALEwEAmpwYAAABK0lEQVR42o2S246CQAyG5/2fjRuRGAkCUSOgIoocVaCbr5shJOvFTtK00/b/e5gxeZ5L13XSNI20bTsLd/yXy0X2+73sdjs5n8/S9/2f3LquZRgG2W63Yh6PhwKXCVbwV1Ulx+NRSZ/P59dcCkAYBIEYOhjHUaZpmrW1EQ5TXK9XtfEB/pa32WzEMMbtdtPqVKJjbEBUv9/vOiadFUWhPojKslQBg2bs9Xr9S0j1MAxltVpJHMdKaHeVZZkmImmaKjHFIImiSP2+7+tqXNcVAwB2HIfDYd7L+/1WQnSSJPo4dn+MaB+G/UJOnhLSIQE6ojIgbECfz0djaAC2EDG7BmK2a8/zxMBuAa/XS/XStrGlvcyzdw5fy7AHxmaspbAv5D/+0+mkP8FxHPkBdwSvSaKC+bMAAAAASUVORK5CYII=&apos;); background-size: cover; display: block;\"></span>\n  <picture>\n        <source srcset=\"/static/94502863777ec6cc601ad486f6de63b4/a0b58/with_k3d.webp 230w,\n/static/94502863777ec6cc601ad486f6de63b4/bc10c/with_k3d.webp 460w,\n/static/94502863777ec6cc601ad486f6de63b4/52d01/with_k3d.webp 501w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 501px) 100vw, 501px\" type=\"image/webp\">\n        <source srcset=\"/static/94502863777ec6cc601ad486f6de63b4/81c8e/with_k3d.png 230w,\n/static/94502863777ec6cc601ad486f6de63b4/08a84/with_k3d.png 460w,\n/static/94502863777ec6cc601ad486f6de63b4/55811/with_k3d.png 501w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 501px) 100vw, 501px\" type=\"image/png\">\n        <img class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\" src=\"/static/94502863777ec6cc601ad486f6de63b4/55811/with_k3d.png\" alt=\"with k3d\" title=\"with k3d\" loading=\"lazy\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\">\n      </picture>\n    </span><p>Because the nodes are containers we are going to need to do a little bit of configuring to get those working like we want them.

During the course, you will develop your own application. The technologies used for the application do not matter - for the examples we're going to use <a href=\"https://nodejs.org/en/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">node.js</a> but the example application will be offered through GitHub as well as Docker Hub.</p><p>Let's launch an application that generates and outputs a hash every 5 seconds or so.</p><p>I have prepared one <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes-hy/material-example/tree/master/app1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">here</a>, you can test it with <code class=\"language-text\">docker run jakousa/dwk-app1</code>.</p><p>To deploy an image, we need the cluster to have an access to the image. By default, Kubernetes is intended to be used with a registry. K3d offers <code class=\"language-text\">import-images</code> command, but that won't work when we switch to non-k3d solutions. We will use the familiar registry <em>Docker Hub</em>, which we also used in <a href=\"http://devopswithdocker.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">DevOps with Docker</a>. If you've never used Docker Hub, it is the place Docker client defaults to. E.g. when you run <code class=\"language-text\">docker pull nginx</code>, the nginx comes from Docker Hub. You will need to register an account there and after that you can use <code class=\"language-text\">docker login</code> to authenticate yourself. If you don't wish to use Docker Hub you can also use a local registry: follow the <a href=\"https://k3d.io/v5.3.0/usage/registries/?h=registries#using-a-local-registry\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">tutorial here</a> to set one up.</p><div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"console\"><pre class=\"language-console\"><code class=\"language-console\">$ docker tag _image_ _username_/_image_\n$ docker push _username_/_image_</code></pre></div><text-box name=\"Example applications\" variant=\"hint\">\nIn the future, the material will use the offered applications in the commands.

The fact that you can apply manifest from the internet just like that will come in handy.</p><p>Instead of deleting the deployment we could just apply a modified deployment on top of what we already have. Kubernetes will take care of rolling out a new version. By using tags (e.g. <code class=\"language-text\">dwk/image:tag</code>) with the deployments each time we update the image we can modify and apply the new deployment yaml. Previously you may have always used the 'latest' tag, or not thought about tags at all. From the tag Kubernetes will know that the image is a new one and pulls it.</p><p>When updating anything in Kubernetes the usage of delete is actually an anti-pattern and you should use it only as the last option. As long as you don't delete the resource Kubernetes will do a rolling update, ensuring minimum (or none) downtime for the application. On the topic of anti-patterns: you should also always avoid doing anything imperatively! If your files don't tell Kubernetes and your team what the state should be and instead you run commands that edit the state you are just lowering the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_factor\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">bus factor</a> for your cluster and application.</p><exercise name='Exercise 1.03: Declarative approach'><p>In your \"Log output\" application create the folder for manifests and move your deployment into a declarative file.</p><p>Make sure everything still works by restarting and following logs.</p></exercise><exercise name='Exercise 1.04: Project v0.2'><p>Create a deployment.yaml for the project.</p><p>You won't have access to the port yet but that'll come soon.</p></exercise><p>Note applying a new deployment won't update the application unless the tag is updated.
